# APIFlow
A customizable Swift Codable API client library

## Motivation
Concept of a fully customizable API library, with injectable steps.

## Implementation Status
The API works, most of it is unit tested but it has not been used (to my knowledge) in any commercial project.  The code of each "action" is relatively simple so I'm confident there aren't too many bugs in there.  Documentation is definitely missing, check out the SampleApp's files "ServerAPI.Swift" and "ServerAPI+Login.Swift" for how it can be used.
